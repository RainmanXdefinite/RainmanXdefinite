# About me
I am a ROBLOX player since 2018. Playing ROBLOX is what got me into programming; I quickly learned Lua and game programming in ROBLOX as a whole. I picked up other languages like
VBScript, HTML and CSS.

# Is there anyway I can help?
Sure! If you can commit, post discussions or issues or even share my profile/repos with people that counts as help too! Dont be afraid to ask a question in discussions, we all get
a moment where we need to question what `<img src="rick-astley.jpg" title="If youre reading this you got rickrolled XDDD" />` or `while true do rickroll(player) wait(4) end` means.
